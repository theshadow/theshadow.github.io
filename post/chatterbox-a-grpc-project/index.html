        <p>I was recently thinking about starting a gRPC project just to kick the tires and get a feel for how the technology worked. In the past I&rsquo;ve only played with it for a short while and this was during the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto2-spec">proto2</a> days. To give this a go I spent a couple of days learning about the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/proto3-spec">proto3</a> specification and then trying to think of something worth spending the time and effort on.</p>
<p>After a bit of thinking about how to use the duplex streaming that the framework provides I decided upon writing an IRC-like server and client. I figured this was complex enough to merit the attention and simple enough to implement over a couple of weeks during my spare time. With all of this in mind I started the <a href="https://github.com/theshadow/chatterbox">chatterbox</a> github repository and started to hack away. True to my method I started by spending a couple of days studying other &ldquo;chat&rdquo; implementations and trying to understand how the duplex would be implemented in the Go programming language.</p>
<p>Once I had an idea of how the duplex would work, which came down to using managing Go routines to track ingress and egress traffic I started to lay down the basics of what I wanted to implement. At first I&rsquo;ll admit I probably tried to go too far but eventually I settled on implementing four of the basic IRC commands. Those were <strong>join</strong>, <strong>part</strong>, <strong>ping</strong>, and <strong>msg</strong>. With these commands I could support multiple channels and all of the basic behavior seen in an IRC server implementation.</p>
<p>It took me about two days of hacking to get to a point where I&rsquo;d call it <em>pre-alpha</em>, that is it will compile, it may not work, and will definitely have bugs. Feel free to check it out. I&rsquo;ll attempt to move it into a true alpha release in the next couple of weeks and hopefully a beta version by the end of the year. If you have any questions feel free to reach out. I don&rsquo;t plan to implement any other commands but do plan to get the commands that exist and the client and server into beta state.</p>
