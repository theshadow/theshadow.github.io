      <description>Yay another website Yep it&amp;rsquo;s that time again, that time where I have the spare time to look at my personal website and make a decision about what I want it to be about and what content I want to live on it. I think this is a good start.</description>

      <description>Greetings and Salutations This website is a place to collect my random musings and thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional software engineer since 2006 and have a breadth of experience in many industries. I pride myself on writing software in a clean and maintainable way. I&amp;rsquo;m not that big of a blogger so you may not find too many updates to the website but when I feel like it I&amp;rsquo;ll post things about my interests.</description>
